The bags are packed and ready to go! The hardest thing about going away is always saying goodbye to family. We set off in good time for Gatwick ready for our flight at 9pm. Once at the airport the realisation of our world travels actually began to set in. We arrived at JFK at 12.05am, where we then made our way to our AirBnB.

As we got in so late, we slept in on Saturday morning as best we could - due to our body clocks being a little off track!! We made an early start to our first day (also Nikki's birthday) in Brooklyn, and had a lovely day of 30C heat ahead of us! We started the day by catching the Metro to see Brooklyn bridge. We then moved on by heading to 7th Avenue/Madison Square Garden for a spot of lunch at Cinnamon Snail in Pennsy Food Hall, which filled us up for our walk towards Central Park via Times Square. When we got to Central Park we aimed for Bethesda Terrace, which we had previously visited on a trip last October, and there was so much pop-up entertainment there that we decided this was a great place to relax before going for a walk around Central Park. We then went back to the flat to freshen up before going out in the evening to watch wrestling. One of our main reasons for coming to Brooklyn was to see WWE NXT Takeover Brooklyn, so after a day out exploring Manhattan, we headed to the Barclays Center. This was an amazing show and it was great to be there in person rather than just watching on TV!

After a lie in on Sunday, we headed for a walk to Williamsburg where we wanted to try a couple of vegan resturants which have been highly recommened online. Sadly it was raining a bit so the weather was not the greatest to be walking in, but it was lovely to be outside in the slightly cooler weather than Saturday! When we got to Williamsburg we went to McCarren Park, which would have been a great spot to sit and eat lunch, but the rain put a little dampener on that one! As we wandered past the Sunday Baseball players in the park, dodging any ball which looked like they were heading our way, Nikki noticed a Starbucks just across the street from park and was straight in there as she craved a cup of Tea! Once Nikki had a tea in her hand, we headed out in the still pouring rain and wandered round the streets looking at various shops. We then made our way towards the vegan pizza shop - Screamer's Pizza, and had pizza slices the size of our heads for lunch!! Once we were fuelled up on pizza we headed back to the flat where enroute we stopped by Dunwell Doughnuts for some yummy doughnuts!
