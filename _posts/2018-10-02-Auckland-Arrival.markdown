After a lovely 9 hour flight we are finally here in Auckland! Sadly when we arrrived it was 10pm, so everything was a bit dark! But we are so excited to finally be here in New Zealand where the real adventure begins, and we dont have to catch a flight every week! Fortunately, as we had booked a 7 day welcome pack with STA travel, we had a bus ready to take us from the airport to our hostel, which was a 45 minute journey. At this point we were definitely ready for some sleep! Once we arrived at the Hostel - which was by far the best hostel we have stayed in to date, we got some rest ready to go explore Auckland on Monday. So Monday started with n orientation meeting at IEP office, which was where we would have guidance with our New Zealand Bank account and getting a job - which for Nikki was quite important! The Orientation took about 3 hours and during that time we gained a lot of information, with people able to give the guidance on how to apply for jobs, and bookings for various places around New Zealand. Once we had left the meeting we decided to go get ourselves some lunch before heading back to the IEP office to make use of their free WiFi, so Nikki could apply for some jobs. 

By Tuesday Nikki had heard from an agency so was going to an interview on Wednesday regarding some potential jobs. Tuesday we also moved from the hostel to a nearby apartment. After Nikki's interview she found out that she'd be starting a job on Monday as a concierge at ASB bank in the city.

Friday we went whale/dolphin watching, which was great, but sadly we saw no whales!

Saturday we headed to the Ferry Terminal where we got a ferry to Rangitoto Island. We spent the morning walking around the island and hiked up the 850ft volcano. Once at the summit, the views of Auckland and all the surrounding islands were incredible.

Sunday we then made another move to a new apartment, where we'd be til Monday 1st October, again just a short walk from the city centre.

The next week was fairly uneventful, as we spent every day working! However, Saturday quickly came around and we caught the 15 minute ferry to Devonport. We climbed the small 87m mountain known as Mount Victoria, before spending a bit of time in the town to get some food and look around the shops. Sunday we visited a local park/lake and enjoyed a more chilled afternoon before another hard week's work ahead!

We them moved again on Monday (Oct 1st), and headed to New Lynn. This accommodation is a bit further out of town, and Nikki will take a 45 min train to work now! We're here for the month of October before moving back into the city again. It's nice being in quieter area, and being able to settle in for a longer period of time! We'll use our time here as an opportunity to hire a car and travel a bit further afield some weekends.
