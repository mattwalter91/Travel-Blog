After a great time in Melbourne, Sunday was another day of moving on, today we were heading to Melbourne Airport to fly to Tasmania where we are staying for the next 3 nights. Luckily as it was a domestic flight we didnt need to get to the airport too early prior to the flight, and we were checked in and bags dropped by just after 10am, therefore leaving us with over 2 hours before we were to board. The flight itself was a short 1 hour journey. Once we arrived to we made our way to our lovely accomadation for the next 3 nights. Once unpacked we made our way to the nearest shops which was a 20 minute walk. After coming back from the shps, we spent the rest of the afternoon resting as we were pretty tired from the flight. 

Monday was already upon us and we have a lovely nights sleep at our new apartment, today we woke early and headed to the sand coloured buolding of Salamanca, which is well known for it 300+ markets held every saturday. So sadly we missed out on this! But to see the street was great and you can tell there is so much history within each building, from Salamanca we headed to Battery point, before steadily making our way back to the apartment, via the harbour, as we are watching the wrestling today, so another chilled day, as tomorrow we have a whole day tour which is for 11 hours!
