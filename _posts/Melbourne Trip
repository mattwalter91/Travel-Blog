After a lovely few days in Waiheke Island, it was time to move onto our next trip which was to sunny Australia! Wednesday Morning began with the last bit of packing before we made our way to the Ferry terminal. We were very kindly offered a car ride to the ferry terminal by our host Ray, which was very kind, but we didnt head straight to the ferry, he showed us round some of the island we had not seen and gave us ideas of places to visit when we return to Waiheke in April. After a lovely tour we were dropped off at the Ferry terminal by around 10.15 am, therefore the next available ferry was a short 15 minute wait, before heading back to Auckland. As the road outside the Auckland Ferry terminal was pretty busy, we decided we needed to move to a better location for the Uber to collect us. We walked to the North Wharf, which is where Nikki was working and got a Uber to the airport from here, as it is quite a good location to get on the highway to the airport. Our driver unfortunately managed to drop us off at the Domestic terminal rather than the International, but luckily a free shuttle bus was available to quickly rectify the slight issue. Once we arrived at the Auckland Internal terminal, we tried to see if we could check in but unfortunately we had a ratehr late flight 7.15pm, and were unable to drop our bags until 3.30pm and it was currently 12pm, therefore we grabbed some food and then managed to drop our bags off which was alot easier. Once the bags were dropped and through the security we had a wander and the time to board soon came around. We arrived in Melbourne 9.20pm, and once we had caught an Uber to our accomadation we headed straight to bed as it has been a very long day! 

Last night was suprisingly cool, which was very nice, the City was a bit of different to the green surroundings we have been used to for the past 4+ months. This morning we headed out of the apartment for a quick shop for the next few days. Once we did the shop, we decided to stay in and go out after lunch, to one save money and also miss the work commuters. After a quiet morning, we headed out at 1pm to explore the city, we went to see the Emporium Shopping Mall, which was a huge shopping mall with lots of high end boutique shops. We then headed to AC/DC Lane Graffiti Walls, which there are many lanes in Melbourne with this street art on, but we decided due to the heat and the large size of the city, we chose to see this lane today. After the beautiful art work in AC/DC lane we headed on to Federation Square, which is a large venue for arts, culture and public events, it was an amazing piece of architecture. From Federation sqaure we made our way back to the apartment as at a very warm 38C we were pretty much melting! This evening we will stay in the apartment and just cook a meal as we have a stove and hob which is very handy!
