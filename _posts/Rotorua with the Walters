After a great few days in Auckland, we had to leave our lovely accomadation at Birkenhead, where we would wake to the Tui bird calling, and head on to our next destination which was Rotorua. We all managed to leave the house by 8.45am. Once on the road we made the 2 hour journey to the movie set of the Hobbiton. Once we arrived we grabbed a quick drink before our tour began at 12pm. The tour began by hopping on a bus and being given a guided tour to the Hobbiton set. The bus journey was a short 10 minute drive, once we arrived the rain sadly did fall rather heavily but the tour and the surroundings were incredible! We learnt so much on our tour, and we all got to get up close to many of the little hobbit doors, which most of them were only about 4ft tall! Whilst on the tour we got to go inside the Green Dragon Inn, which is from the film, and get a glass of ginger beer. After lovely drink, we got to see many more of the hobbit doors, before our tour sadly came to an end, and even though the rain did pour the tour was still great, and we would highly recommend anyone who goes to New Zealand to visit as its great fun for anyone! After a great trip, we made the 1 hour journey to our accomadation which was a 4 bedroom house, in Rotorua. Once we arrived we all got unpacked and settled in. We decided to have dinner out, so we headed up the road to a resturant called Burger Fuel which is an upmarket burger resturant. After dinner we went food shopping for the time whilst we are in Rotorua. Once we were home we all had a quiet evening before a busy next few days.
