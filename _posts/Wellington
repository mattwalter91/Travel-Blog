Today was a very early start, as we were up at 3.00am for our flight to Wellington. Our first flight was at 6.00am to Melbourne from Tasmania, before a connecting flight from Melbourne to Wellington. After the two flights we finally arrived in Wellington at 3.30pm. The day felt very long and we were both very tired after the incredibly early start, from the airport we got an Uber to our accomadation for the next 12 days, which was an Airbnb in Newtown, Wellington. Once we were unpacked we made our way to the shops to buy enough for the evening meal and breakfast before we had a very early night as we were both very tired. 

Thursday was soon upon us and we went out and brought food for the next 7 days, which was a nice feeling as we had not done this sort of shop in a while due to all the moving we have been doing in the last month. After the shops we had a quiet day, as Matt wanted to do some work, so we are spending Thursday and Friday not doing much too, and then spending the rest of our time in Wellington looking round. 

Friday was soon upon us and we decided to take a walk to Warehouse which is similar to the Range in the Uk, and we went to pick up some oven gloves as it seems no accomodation has any, and we also picked up a chromecast, so we could watch some films and various tv shows in our free time. After we had purchased our items we headed back towards to house and stopped for lunch at Burgerfuel, before heading back to the flat. Tomorrow we have an early start as we are off to hire a car and head a bit further out the City. 

The weekend is already here and today was an early start as we had a car to collect for 9am. To get to the bargain car hire it was a 30 minute walk. After we collected the car we headed to Otari Falls and Wiltons Bush which was a short 15 minute drive, once we arrived we walked a Circular route which took about 30 minutes, before heading on to Korokoro dam, which is a manmade waterfall, which was obviously impressive, but was not the same as a natural waterfall. We then headed on to Percy waterfall which is a short 16 minute walk, which was within a lovely national park. Once at the national park we made our way to the waterfall which was tucked away through the park, which was wonderful. After taking in the lovely waterfall we headed back to the car and had our lunch, before taking the car back and having a rest as the walks were very uphill! 

Sunday was already around as today we popped to the shops and brought a few treats before having a quiet day, planning the rest of our time in Wellington. 

Monday was soon around and it was an early start, as we were going to Weta Cave, which is where some of the well known films have been created! We caught the bus from Newtown where we are staying to Weta Cave, and headed to the studios where we got a complimentary documentary and then a 50 minute tour through the studios seeing the amazing costumes and techniques used in multimillion pound films. After the tour we made our way back to the apartment and spent the afternoon chilling.
