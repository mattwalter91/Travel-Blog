So the weekend of the Road trip has come upon us! Saturday 5th was the day we headed from our AirBnB in St Johns to the City, to pick up our hire car for the next 2 weeks! We chose to use EziCar Rentals, as they were a good price for a vehicle and insurance, the car itself is a very nice brand new Toyota Corolla, so a nice economical car for a long road trip! Saturday was a day of then just heading back to the house, to get packed ready to leave 10am Sunday Morning. 
Sunday came around and after an early start, to get the house tidied before the owner came to meet us for 10, we set off for our trip. As the organisational type people we are, we have actually planned our whole trip, with what we will be seeing and wear we are going to stay along the way. Our drive to the Northland, started off as a quick stop at the supermarket for the nexts worth of food: as because we are staying in motels we cant buy a large amount due to fridge/freezer space is minimal. Once the shop was done we begain the lovely drive by St Heliers and Mission Bay, we chose not to stop at every beach going, as we would not get very far as there are so many and on a hot 27C day everyone wants to be at the beach so parking would of been an issue! From Mission bay we drove again close to the bays and towards to city, where we took a quick drive into the city and out the otherside towards the Auckland Harbour Bridge which we actually drove over on our way to our first stop which was Shakespeare National Park, which had a beautiful beach and parklands, on a hot day like today, we just had a lovely stroll on the beach and then made our way to a little waterfall within the national park before heading on to our motel, where we will be for the night before another day of travelling tomorrow!
