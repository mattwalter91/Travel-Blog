Wednesday was a long day as we were travelling from Dunedin to Invercargill, which alone is 2 hour 30 minutes. We got packed up and on the road by 9.15am, we then made the first leg of the journey which wan 1hour 30 minutes to Nugget Point, where we stopped for photos and a short 10 minute walk to the lighthouse, and to view the nugget rocks. After Nugget point we headed back on the road and travelled a further 45 minute journey to Jack Blowhole, which was nestled a 20 minute walk from the car park, the walk was a variety of uphill and downhill tracks, once at the blowhole, we were slightly disappointed as we had hoped for spouts of water being blown up, but unfortunately it just seemed that sea water, got into the rock area and was just not doing much else, so sadly a little disappointing. We then stopped for a quick bite to eat by Jacks Bay before heading back on the road for a short 30 minute drive where we arrived at Purakanui Falls, which was a short 10 minute drive to the falls, which were great to see even if it was not at it most fullest, due to the time of year! After Purakanui Falls, we drove a short 20 minutes and we went to our final stop which was Koropuku falls, which was a falls, Matt and I found out about via the local news, as two old men found the falls and created a safe path to the falls. Once we walked through the bush, which looked so untouched and arrived at the falls it had such a great feeling that is was not known about and therefore we were the only visitors there, which made it feel so magical. After taking a few photos we headed back to the car and drove the remaining hour to our accomadation in Invercargill. Once at the accomadation, which was very different as we enter the house via the bathroom! We dropped our bags off and headed off to the shops to buy food for the week. Once back from the shops we had dinner before heading to bed ready for the next day!

Thursday was a day just Ivona and I would be going out, we had plans to head to the town and to a nearby beach. When we both got up it was rather chilly, so we slowly got ourselves ready and were out the door by about 9.30am. We headed first into the town of Invercargill, which to be honest was a little bland, there was not much about so we decided to park up and go for a walk around the town, as we had read there was a few things that are worth visiting. We first began by having a short walk through a large department store which the car park we had parked in was attached to, once we had a browse we headed on to Oreti park, where we went to look at the St Mary's Basilca, and then went on to Queens garden where we visited the Water tower, whilst by the Queens garden we walked around and visitied the Avairy, nature corner and rose gardens, which were probably one of the best parts of the town! After the lovely stroll through the Queen gardens, we made our way back to the car and drove back to the house, where we grabbed some lunch. After lunch we headed back out to Oreti beach, which was a large beach, where vehicles were able to drive on. We had a lovely stroll in the sun before heading back to the car and onto a place known as Demolition World, which was basically a worn down area of buildings, to be honest it was not that great and felt if anything very eerie. After Demolition World, we headed back to the house as tomorrow we have a very long day at the Milford Sound.
