After a busy couple of days in Auckland seeing the Arctic Monkeys and then back to Christchurch, we collected our large backpacks from Jabyn and headed to our accommodation for 2 nights, so Nikki's friend Ivona can see a small part of Christchurch before headed further south. We landed from Auckland at 3pm on Thursday afternoon, and had a hire car to pick up for 3.30pm before heading back to the airport to pick up Ivona for 5pm. Once we collected Ivona we headed back to the apartment, where we grabbed pizza and spent the evening in, as we were all tired. 

Friday we did a food shop, before heading to Hanmer Springs which was a long 1 1/2 hour journey, and unfortunately the weather was not really on our side, but we still headed to the springs where we were outside in 40C hot pools which was lovely and also an experience!

Saturday we headed to Dunedin which was where we were staying for the next 4 nights. The journey was a long 4 1/2 hour journey, but we broke the journey up which a break in Timaru, and grabbed some lunch at Burgerfuel before continuing on. We arrived at our house for the next few days by 4.30pm, once we arrived we dropped our stuff in the house before heading back out to the shops for the next few days worth of food. After the food shop we had a look at the 1 block over St Clair beach which was lovely to be within a 5 minute walk away.

Sunday Matt stayed in to keep on top of work, therefore just leaving Ivona and I to head out, we headed to Aramoana, which is a small coastal town, we headed to boardwalk by the beach, whilst taking a walk along the boardwalk we spotted around 1o seals which was great to see even on a very windy day, like it was on Sunday. After taking a walk we headed to the Keyhole Rock on the beach, which we walked a good stretch of the beach as we were keeping an eye out for the Yellow-eyed penguins but some locals advised they would be seen at another bay which we would look at later in the week. When we walked back from the keyhole rock we noticed a sea lion bathing itself in sand which was great to see! After feeling a little windswept we headed on to Moeraki Boulders, which was a long 1 hour journey, but was great to see them, even if it was very busy! After walking around the boulders we headed back to the car and stopped off by Katiki beach, which we spotted on the way to Dunedin on Saturday. After a quick stop at Katiki beach we took a spontaneous stop off at Shag point, where we saw many more seals and some great rock formations. After visiting Shag point, we made our way to Nicols falls which was a 40 minute journey, once there we made our way to the falls, mainly following our nose as the signs were not the best! Once we finally got to the falls it was well worth it as it looked great. We then headed back to the car and headed home after a long 9-5 day out! It's a shame Matt didn't get to see the seals and sealions but hopefully we can see some more when he comes out with us!

Monday soon came around and this morning Ivona and I headed to the beach in the morning to see the sunrise, which although there was a few clouds in the way we still managed to get a couple of nice photos. After seeing the sunrise we headed back to the house before getting ready to go to Tunnel beach. After getting our bags packed for our day trip we headed to Tunnel beach which was a short 7 minute drive. Once at the tunnel beach we made the steep downhill walk to Tunnel beach which was a short 1 km away. Once down at the beach we admired the beautiful tunnel like rock formations. After looking around tunnel beach we had the hard task of climbing up the steep 1 km track back to the car. Once back at the car we headed to Grahams Bush scenic reserve, which was a 40 minute journey. We arrived at Hall Road near Sawyers Road which was the closest place to park in order to do the bush reserve 4 km return walk. Once parked up we made our way through the Grahams Bush, before we then reached Mount Cargill Road which we crossed and headed onto the Mount Cargill walking track which lead us to the Organ Pipes which was an amazing rock formation. Once we finally got close to the Organ pipes we were very hot from the uphill walking, and once we got close we had to do a bit of rock climbing to get up close and stand on the organ pipes, let's say with us both having a fear of heights this certainly tested us! After stopping for lunch on the rocks we made our way back down, the rocks which was worse than going up, as you had to walk down backwards! Once down we headed back to the car. Once back at the car we cooled off and got cleaned off as the rock climbing had caused us to get a bit dirty. Once freshened up we changed and headed to Dunedin town, where we looked around the shops and admired some of the amazing buildings, before heading into town we stopped at Baldwin Street which is the world's steepest street, we didn't climb it as we have climbed up too many hills today! After a quick stop at Baldwin Street we headed into town and looked at the Train station which was a beautiful building before heading through the town looking at the various shops. We finally headed home for 5pm, where we had a quiet evening, and an early night as we were up early to see the sunrise!

Tuesday was all headed out together for 9am, we made our way to Larnach Castle, which was a short 25 minute journey, once there we spent 1 1/2 hours at the castle looking around the gardens and the castle before heading off to Albatross point, where we got to see a few seals but unfortunately no sightings of penguins. After Albatross point we headed to Sandfly bay which is where we had been advised in Aramoana there should be sightings of the yellow eyed penguins.Sandfly bay was pretty hard work to get there and back as it was down a steep hill, which was made up of mainly sand, so hard on our legs. After the Sandfly bay we headed home so Matt could work, Ivona and I decided to head out to St Clair beach, which was lovely as the sun was out, which has been a change from the past few days! Tomorrow we move from Dunedin to Invercargill where we will be for the next 5 days, and we have many more exciting trips planned, so watch this space!
