Sunday was a lovely early start to catch an Uber to get across to the airport for our flight at 9am. The flight was a nice 5 hour journey. Once we arrived at Honolulu airport, we headed to the town of Waikiki, where we have a room in an apartment booked for 6 nights. As soon as we left the airport, the tempreature difference hit us as the temperature here was a hot and sticky 30C compared to San Fran's more 'sea breeze' type air at around 20C. Once we were sorted at the apartment, we decided to head for a little walk to go see the beach, and what was near by. We then decided to have an early night as we were pretty tired from the flying.

Monday was upon us and we decided to look at booking a couple of tours whilst in Hawaii. Unfortunately a visit to one of the other islands was way out of budget, at about £500 each! So we booked more low-key tours for Tuesday and Thursday. Today we walked 2km away to Ala Moana shopping centre where we had a look around the shops. After having lots of food for lunch, we headed on to Wholefoods to buy a few essentials for our stay at the apartment and for our tours over the next few days. Sadly those alarm clocks were set again for Tuesday with our tour guide from Oahu Nature Tours picking us up from a nearby hotel at 7.30am for the Ultimate Circle Tour of Honolulu.

On the way to the meeting point for the tour we made a few pit stops for breakfast, at McDonalds and Starbucks. Once at the pickup point, we were shortly met by our tour guide Monique, who was very welcoming! Our first stop was near the Diamond Head Crater, where we stopped at the Amelia Earheart monument which overlooks the Pacific Ocean. We then continued on and travelled along Oahu's spectacular southeast coastline where we arrived at the famous Halona Blowhole and “From Here to Eternity” beach where Green Sea Turtles can often be spotted, but sadly not for us today! Next up was the Makapu’u Lookout where we enjoyed incredible panoramic views of offshore islands, turquoise and azure ocean water and breathtaking lava cliffs above. We continued to the world-renowned Pali Lookout, that Mark Twain called the most beautiful views on the planet. Driving north we arrived at the Valley of the Temples and visited the colorful Byodo-in temple, which was incredible. Here we saw wild peacocks and hundreds of koi carp with a large reflecting pond, and small waterfalls. We then continued on the relaxing windward coast where we saw the scenic Chinaman’s Hat, a picturesque islet located in the warm, tropical waters of Kaneohe Bay. On the road again we headed north to Kahuku, where we visited the locals’ favorite shrimp trucks, where we were served Lunch. After lunch we set on to the world famous Sunset Beach. This is the legendary big-wave surfing location where towering, giant waves arrive between November-April. Next we visited Waimea Valley and Waterfall. This location showcases over 5,000 species of tropical flowering plants, ancient archaeological sites, and one of the most scenic waterfalls on the island. Our last stop was the historic Dole Plantation where there was many colorful varieties of pineapple species from all over the world. Sadly there was no actual pineapple juice, so a bit of a let down for us! Once back home which was about 5.30pm we made some food before heading to sleep. As we are uncertain on what we are doing on Wednesday as there is the back end of a storm hitting the island.

Wednesday we woke to high winds and lots of rain, which made us think we were back home! So today was one of those rainy days which is annoying as we want to be out exploring the island, but sadly we decided to mainly have a dry day indoors. We decided at lunch to head to the Shopping Village we visited on Monday, as we needed to return a t-shirt and get something to eat. We opted for a taxi to keep dry, but still ended up getting soaked on a short walk between shops! Luckily we quickly got our shopping and headed back to the apartment to warm up! Wednesday evening we had an email to say our tour to the Manoa Falls had been cancelled due to the high winds and rainful! So we will see what happens over the next couple of days.

Thursday came around and the weather was still hideous! We had hoped to go climb the Diamond Head Crater, but due to the high winds and torrential downpours we sadly decided the idea of walking in heavy rain was not for us! Once the rain had cleared a little headed out to the shops (again) nearby our apartment, and looked around for little gifts and general browsing. After lunch we walked via the beach back to the apartment, where we had a quiet afternoon, before our tour to the Monoa Falls on Friday.

On Friday we headed to the meeting point for 8am, where we took a tour bus to Monoa Falls. The journey took us through the rainforest, which our tour guide told us were the areas in which big films like Jurassic Park were filmed! The tour began by a walk through the forests, which were amazing, as there was so many different types of trees and places!. The tour took us up many steps, which due to the previous days rain, were rather wet and muddy, but the destination was well worth it. The falls itself was incredible! It's a very popular attraction with a lot of people visiting; especially since it'd been closed the day before. After a few hours in the jungle we headed back to the minibus, which took us back to Waikiki. Once we had been dropped off we headed to grab some food for the afternoon, before getting ourselves all packed up and ready for our flight to Auckland on Saturday.

So next time we update, we will have moved twice, as we have decided to rent an apartment for 5 days, as a hostel is not ideal for us being able to work! We are very much looking forward to the next chapter of our adventure, but for now Aloha!
