Wednesday has now come upon us and yet again we are off on the move again. Today we finish the Northland trip, which has been lovely, and make our way to the Coromandel Peninsula. We left Parakai where we were staying at the Geothermal Hotel, and made the lengthy 1hour 20 minute journey to Hunua Falls, which was just south of Auckland City. After the long drive we made our way to the Hunua Falls reserve where we looked at the wonderful 30 metre high falls. Once we admired the falls we made the decision to head for a walk round the reserve, we choose to head to the Cosseys Dam, which was a very long uphill walk, and after the mistake of not taking the water bottle, once we reached the Dam which was a good 45 minute uphill walk, we were very thirsty.  We took in the views at the Dam before making our way back to the car, as we were pretty much gasping for a drink! Once back at the car we made the 1 hour journey to Thames which is just into the Coromandel Peninsula. We popped to the shops before making our way to the Coastal Motor Lodge where we are staying for the night before heading up to the Coromandel.

After a lovely evening in the Coastal Lodge-Thames, we got packed before making our way to the Coromandel Peninsula. After a very scenic drive by all the bays we made our way to New Chums beach, which was very pretty as soon as we got close. We actually first walked by Whanapoua Beach, and then made our way to the New Chum walkway which consisted of walking over rocks and a wooded walkway, which was lovely especially as it was a very warm day! Once we arrived at the New Chum beach, we were very happy as it was a beautiful white sand with a lovely blue sea, with rather wild waves! It was so lovely to see one of the top 10 beaches in New Zealand. After having a lovely walk on the beach, we then made our way back to the car before making our way to the next accomadation for the night which is just in Coromandel at the Little farm, which was a lovely little cottage and has everything we require. Friday is going to be a busy day fitting in lots of different places on the way round the rest of the coromandel.

After a lovely stay at the Little Farm Cottage, we packed up and made our way 60km to Whitianga Countdown. Even though our car sat nav disapproved, we made our journey to Whitianga on the 309 Road, which was pretty much a gravel road for 30km! We noticed a waterfall (Waiau Falls) was nearby and therefore made a quick stop off, and it was amazing! Especially as it was not a planned stop and was lovely because we were the only people there! After a quick stop, we were back on the road and reached our first destination as Countdown (the shops), as we needed to grab a few bits to take us into Saturday. Once again we were back on the road, and after a short 30 minute journey we arrived at our first stop which was Hahei, where we walked from Hahei to Catheral Cove. The walk was pretty tough especially when it was about 27C, and the walk was on different terrains and inclines, lets say we could do with a swim by the time we reached the Cove, although a cloudy day the Cove, was still amazing to see! After we admired the Cove, we made the long walk back to the car which was a 75 minute walk from the Cove to the car. Once back we headed on to Hot Water beach. We parked at a cark park just a short 600 metres from hot water beach, and we sure knew it was hot water beach, as the sand was very hot! Unfortunately due to the time we got to the beach, the tide was in, and therefore the hot pools were no longer hot, and people were literally digging 4ft deep to try find the warmth! Although we missed the opportunity, it was nice to see what everyone raves about, but after all the walking today, we definitely would not be up for the digging! After a dissapointing stop, we made our way back to the car and headed a short 20 minute drive to our accomadation at Paku Lodge Resort Motel, which was lovely as the room looked out at the Tairua Marina, which was lovely to watch in the evening. Tomorrow is sadly our last day with the hire car and last day of our Northland Trip, so we are off back to Auckland, but we have some exciting visits coming up soon!

So today marks the last day of the Northland trip, today we had to make sure we were up early to get back to the city to check the car in for 12pm, and with a 2 hour journey ahead we needed to allow time for traffic. Luckily we had a pretty smooth drive home as the route was on highways, once we had checked the car in, we caught an Uber to our apartment at Star Queens, for the night just on Queen street, although small the apartment was in a good location, ready for another move tomorrow when we head to the Harbour and catch a Fuller ferry over to Waiheke, for our the next 3 days, so lots of exciting things to come but Saturday has been a pretty quiet one mainly as we have moved around alot and it is nice to spend the afternoon in when it's a very warm 25C.
