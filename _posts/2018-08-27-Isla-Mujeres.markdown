Wow, so Mexico has proved to be truly amazing with all the Mayan history we've learnt about. Our next stop was Isla Mujeres; Spanish for "Women Island" is an island in the Gulf of Mexico, about 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) off the Yucat√°n Peninsula coast. We were on the island for 4 days, having caught the ferry from Puerto Jaurez, Cancun. To our suprise this was ridiciously busy as many locals take day trips to the island due to the flexibility of the ferries.

Once we had the short 20 minute boat ride to the island we went to Bahia Chic Chia which was literlly a 5 minute walk from the ferry terminal, meaning our room view was just fantastic!

An odd thing about this island is the most common mode of transport is golf buggys or mopeds! It was great, but we decided not to hire one as we prefer using our feet! So the first evening we headed to the only vegan restaurant which was nestled within the small streets just a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The portions were massive but in the heat over here of an average 30C it's been quite a struggle in wanting to eat much anyway!

Sunday was our only tour for our stay in Isla Mujeres, which was a snorkelling tour. This did not begin until 2pm, so it meant we had plenty of time to relax in the morning. Whilst on our walk to the meeting point of the tour, we found the Isla Mujeres statue, which was great to see with its back drop of the beautiful ocean. Once we got to the meeting point we found out guide didn't speak any English, which made for an interesting time! We headed to the boat where we set off to some quiet locations to experience the snorkelling in the Gulf of Mexico. Nikki did not parcipitate in the snorkelling, as it's not really her thing, but she still got to see some of the fish from the boat.

We spent Monday on the beach, where we spent all of 2 hours before we decided to head back. Being sat by the sea was incredible. The water was so warm and clear it was amazing. We were later glad we'd only spent a couple of hours there as we ended up quite red even though we generously applied sun screen!

Before heading off the Mexico City, we had a couple of nights at the Marriott hotel near the airport, which was very luxurious.

Next update will be from Mexico City, where we may be ditching the sun screen for the rain coats according to the weather forecast!
