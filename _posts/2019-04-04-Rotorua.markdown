After a few very busy days, moving from Cromwell to Christchurch, which was about a 500 km drive, which if driven in one go, would take about 10 hours, we decided to split it up and it still felt very long! After getting to Christchurch, we decided to have a quiet/rest day before our flight on Wednesday to Auckland. Due to the recent terror attack in Christchurch, the airport was on high security checks, but after dropping our hire car off and getting through security, we were soon on our 3.00pm flight to Auckland. After a short flight we arrived in Auckland, and had to get another hire car before driving 3 hours to Rotorua where we are going to be for the next 6 days. We finally arrived at our AirBnB which was a 5 bedroom house, which was on the mountain side looking over the town of Rotorua. We unfortunately arrived late, so we quickly grabbed some food before an early night.

Thursday we had a booked ticket to Te Puia Village, which is a tourist attraction which has a Maori Village, natural Geysers and a Kiwi enclosure. We also had a entry pass to the Maori Cultural experience, where we got to watch a traditional welcoming ceremony, fighting and the Haka, which we were then able to take part in learning the Haka and dance. The experience was amazing to see what the Maori Culture is like, it was well worth the money, especially as we were able to keep out the rain! After the experience we headed out and decided to make our own way around the rest of the park seeing the Geysers, Mud pools, hot pools and ovens. The smell around Rotorua and the park, smells very strongly of Sulphur, let's say you need to have a strong nose to live here! After walking about the park to see the Geysers, we headed to see the Kiwi house and the weaving and carving school which were great to see the detail into how the Maori do the carving and weaving. After a great experience at Te Puia, we headed to Central Mall, where there were many of shops including a Countdown. We went food shopping as we didn't have time to do on Wednesday evening. Once we had done a shop, we headed home and rested for the rest of the afternoon.

Friday was soon around and after a nice lie in we headed to Mount Ngongotaha, where it looked like you could drive the majority of the mountain. On the drive up it seemed you could drive a majority of the way but then you had to walk a further 3km, which we had not dressed for, therefore we decided to head to the shopping Mall for bath salts, as we finally have a couple of houses now that have a bath, so want to make the most of it, unfortunately we could not find our prefered brand in Rotorua therefore we will wait until we are in Auckland and go to a shop we know stocks them, so the rest of the day was a quiet day. We have a long couple of days over the weekend to try and squeeze lots into the weekend, fingers crossed the weather is kind to us!

The weekend was soon here and today we decided to do a few things that were not on our list, as we noticed there was a Gondola and Luge in Rotorua, which was a great find as the Luge was a better version of the one in Queenstown. The Gondola sadly was not as high as the one in the Queenstown, but the views were still great! After the ride up the Gondola we made our way to the Luge track, and the tracks here at Rotorua, were definitely longer and went through the trees which was great! We had 3 rides which were great, but sadly there seemed many people who loved to crash which held us up! After a great 3 rides, we made our way back down the Gondola, which as we did we saw 3 deer, which was lovely to see! Once we were back at the car we headed to the town where we went to the cinema to see the film, 'fighting with my family' which is a wrestling film which was great to see. Once the film finished we headed home and made dinner before an early night as we have a long day tomorrow. 

After an early alarm, we headed out the door for 8am, and made the long 2 hour 15 minute drive to the Tongariro Crossing. Once we arrived at the crossing car park, which annoyingly only had a 4 hour time limit, we made a start on our 8-9 km walk to the Emerald lakes which was the halfway point of the crossing. Due to the 4 hour time limit on the car park we felt like we were against the time to do our walk, therefore were trying to walk at a good pace to be able to walk the 8 km in 2 hours, but what we didn't know was that we would be climbing up to 1800 km, therefore we had a very steep uphill climb. Once we were over half way, the low clouds made the weather quite harsh and the visibility was dramatically reduced the higher we got! When we got to the highest point we found visibility hard and from what we could make out from our maps, it looked like the lakes were too our right, so we went to explore, even though the guidance poles did not point us in that direction, due to visibility we went to investigate but on further investigation it seemed to be a dry lake, therefore we assumed the lakes had just dried up for the summer (which most rivers over the country dry up over the summer), the landscape looked like something you would see on the moon! The lumps of lava were incredible to be walking over and by, as we don't see anything like it in the UK. As you can imagine the higher we got the colder it got, therefore we could not stand still for very long, so after viewing the dried up lake, which we thought was the Emerald lake, we made our way back due to our time restraint on the car. On the walk back, we further investigated what we had seen and unfortunately we were only a further 30 minute walk from the emerald lakes, which are what makes the Tongariro crossing so incredible. On the walk to the car Matt and I have decided we are going to tackle the full 19.4km walk from one end to the other, in a weeks time when Matts family are out here so we can say we have walked the full length, and actually prepare for the cold weather better for the walk. After we got back to the car we ate some lunch before making our way back home, to have an early night as we were both very tired and cold from our walk.

Its crazy its now the 1st of April, therefore just under 3 weeks until we return to the UK! Today we are having a quiet day, and weather permitting we are heading to a Redwood tree top walk to lights this evening, but currently whilst I am sat here writing the blog the rain is absolutely tipping it down! Fingers crossed the weather gets a bit better as we might as well be in the UK with this weather! It certainly is Autumn, and no longer Summer here in New Zealand!
