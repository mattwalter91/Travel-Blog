Wednesday was a early start as we were packing up today and making our way from Richmond down south to Swannanoa which is just a few miles north of Christchurch. The drive was a long 4 hour 30 minute journey, but luckily the scenery was quite nice, although the tight corners were not much fun! We left at 9pm and arrived at Swallows Nest our accommodation for the next 2 weeks which was set in a beautiful gardens, by 2.30pm. Once at the house we unpacked and sat down to have some lunch before having a quiet afternoon/evening.

Thursday was had a quiet day as we were still quiet tired from the long drive, so we just made our way to Rangiora a short 13km drive where we went to the shops to do a weekly foodshop. We also took a stroll through the shops to see what was about as Matt was after a Barbers and I require a beauty salon, which we found, so we decided to head back Monday to go to our required shops! After our visit to the Rangiora we headed back home and had a chilled rest of the day.

Friday was soon around and we made our way to New Brighton, which was a short 30 minute drive, luckily the weather was lovely as sadly the pier and beach, were not what we expected but it was still nice to get a bit of sea air before heading to countdown to buy a couple of bug repellents as unfortunately we had been inundated with many bugs in the house due to the warm weather! After we brought the bug repellents we headed to Travis Wetland Nature Heritage, where we hada short 30 minute walk round the walkways, but it was very hot and the paths were very open so there was not much shelter from the sun. After a walk round the Wetland, we headed back home, and after the sea air we both required a nap! Anyone would think we were in our 50s! We spent the rest of the evening resting and planning further plans for our trip.

Saturday was soon upon us and today we were planning on taking a trip to Akaroa + Ngaio, which was a 1 hour 45 minute car journey there, but once Nikki's alarm went off at 7am, she was not feeling 100% and was pretty tired, therefore we decided to have a quiet morning and head to Bottle Lake Forest Park for a little walk Saturday afternoon, which was lovely but we were hoping to see a lake, but we found out the forest park got its name from a lake which was present in the 1880s! The walk round the pine trees was still nice but we didn't understand the tracks as there was so many and it turned out we ended up walking down a cycle track, where cyclists are mountain biking therefore travelling pretty quickly! After we got ourselves back to the car we headed back home in time for dinner, then headed to bed.

Sunday was upon us as the weather has been very warm and overnight we had the first bit of rain for a while, which was lovely but meant the temperature was a lot colder! Today we are heading to Christchurch to meet up with Jabyn, and go for lunch at Burgerfuel and head to Godley Heads, which was a very wet and windy walk, but the views was lovely. After a lovely walk we headed back through the City, which was very busy, but amazing to see the City since the terrible Earthquakes. After a drive through the City we headed back to Jabyns before we headed off and made our way back home.
