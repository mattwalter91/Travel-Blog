It's amazing how easy airport security is when on an domestic flight! So we have arrived in Mexico City early afternoon on Thursday. Once we had collected our bags we found our Uber for a cheap £6.50 for a 30 minute journey! We seemed to have hit a busy period of Mexico City getting to the apartment in La Condensa, but once we finally got there we were met by the doorman for our AirBnB. He led us into a courtyard and up 3 flights of stair - blimey this was hard work with our 16kg backpacks on our back, plus our rucksacks too! Once we got to the top we got into the apartment and its great, it had everything you could ever need - a kitchen, living area, nice bedroom, and bathroom! We made sure one of our main priorities was to get some washing done as there was a washing machine for us to use! Before we decided to do any washing we headed to find the nearest supermarket, so we could make ourselves something for dinner, luckily a quick 10 minute walk away.

Friday's plan was to have a steady morning, doing lots of washing and then at 1pm we headed out for lunch at a nearby resturant called U.to.pia which has a few great options, like pizza and hot dogs! Once we had some lunch we headed back to the apartment as we have planned to go see the Lucha Libre at Arena Mexico. Although we arrived to the Arena an hour early the buzz in the air was great. Once inside, the atmosphere was electric whilst watching the wrestlers in there bright costumes flip and tumble throughout the air! We left the arena amazed at how great the show was!

Saturday we made our way to Bosque de Chapultepec, which is the main park in Mexico City. Here we walked around the park, which was lovely, before heading to the Museo Nacional de Antropología, to find out more about Mexico's history. Once we spent a couple of hours exploring the amazing sights within the museum we headed back to the park where we walked round a lake in the middle of the park before heading for lunch at a great Taco shop, and it was so yummy!! This was the best native food we've had since being in Mexico.

Sunday we had a very chilled out day, as Monday was going to be quite a long day on a tour to the Teotihuacan Pyramids, where we get to see the Sun and Moon Pyramids!

Monday we had an early start to the day, to get the the Palace of Fine Arts, where we met our tour guide, Leon, who took us from the Fine Arts centre to the cable bus, where to headed on our journey to the Teotihuacan Pyramids. Once the short journey on the had terminated at the bus station we got onto a coach to take us startight to the site. When we arrived we quickly began our tour as the site was getting busier by the minute, as everyone wants to get there before it gets too hot out. Sadly most of the site was a reconstruction, which did take a bit away from the tour, but it was still great to see the two pyramids and learn a bit about Teotihuacan history. Our guide Leon was great with a huge depth of knowledge regarding the history behind the pyramids.

Climbing the pyramids was knackering, and the altitude doesn't help with that! You can only go half way up the Moon Pyramid, but we were able to go to the very top of the Sun Pyramid where we took in the views over lunch.
