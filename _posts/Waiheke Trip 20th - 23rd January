After a very warm evening in the small apartment in the city, we had a quiet morning in the city before catching the 12.30pm Ferry across to Waiheke Island which is at the Downtown Ferry Terminal, which we got to via a Uber only becuase its quite a long walk to carry our 17kg backpacks. The weather in the City was pretty miserable this morning, so we were a bit worried we were in for bad weather but luckily by the time we got to the ferry the weather was alot more pleasing, which made the boat journey very enjoyable. Once we got off the Ferry at Waiheke we decided to take a taxi to our home for the next 3 nights at Guest house on Queens, which is a lovely 1 bedroom house. The gentleman who owns to accomadation (Ray) warmly greeted us and very kindly gave us lots of great places to visit whilst we are over here in Waiheke, once settled in we were also offered a free car journey by Ray, to the Shops to get everything we require in for the next few days. The rest of the afternoon is going to be planning the rest of our trip. Although this island is about 90 km long, we have not booked a car only because there are great public transport and good walking routes, round the island. So Monday will soon be upon us and we have lots of great ideas planned whilst we are here.

After a lovely first evening in the Guest house, we decided to get up about 9am, and catch a bus which is a short 5 minute walk from the house to Oneroa, which is a beachy town, where we browsed to shops before doing a beach side walk over a few beachs and to some lovely view points. Once we had looked over Fishermans Rock, we had a lovely 15 minute walk back to the house, where we are having a quiet afternoon.
