Monday soon came around, and after a few busy days, today we were setting off to Sydney. From Rotorua we drove a short 40 minutes and stopped off at Putaruru Springs, which was a short 15 minute walk from the car. After a short walk we soon reached the beautiful clear water of the Springs, although the little biting bugs were very much about! After a further 100 metres we had reached the blue springs pond, which was the main part of the Springs. Whilst by the main part, we saw a black swan, majestically gliding through the clear waters. After admiring the beautiful springs, we headed back to the car and continued our journey towards Auckland airport. We drove 2 hours and then made a stop at Hunua Falls, which Matt and I had visited back in January. After a short stop we headed to the Car rental place, to drop our hire car off before catching our 4.15 flight to Sydney. Once at the airport, we only had a short 1 hour 30minute to get to the gate for our flight. Once on the plane we were soon on the way to Sydney, and arrived in Sydney by 6pm. Being in a completely new city i always hard to find your barings, but we finally got to the house by 7.30pm. After grabbing some food from the shops, we all headed for an early night ready for a busy few days before we head back to the UK. 

Tuesday was soon here and today we headed to the Botanical Gardens and Mrs Macquaries viewing point, where we saw the great views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and Opera House. After the great photo oppotunity at the viewing point we headed to the Opera House, before making our way back through the house for some lunch, before a few of us headed back out and went looking for a souvenir shop. After a long 20 minute walk we found a lovely gift shop in the centre of the city at a Westfield shopping mall. After we did some shopping we made our way back to the house before another early night, as the time difference has messed with our body clocks! 

Wednesday was soon here and today we had a booked tour, which was the harbour bridge climb. We made our way to the city by train, and then got to the Harbour bridge climb by 10am, ready for our booked tour at 10.45am. Once kitted up we soon made our way up and over the harbour bridge, which was incredible, and although I thought I was going to be very scared, I felt so safe, as we were put in harnesses and our safety is thought of every step of the way, and the views and weather just made it a perfect day! The hardest part of the climb was the vertical steps we had to climb and decend on from. The actual walking voer the arches of teh bridge was not hard at all! After a long but truely incredible climb, we got back into our own clothes and headed for lunch as we were all very tired and hungy, we all made the decision and walked to the Westfield shopping centre, where we found a burger resturant and all had a bite to eat before we headed back to the house for another quiet evening. Tomorrow is our last full day in Sydney, and then we are off home on Friday, the time here has gone so quickly, but we are very excited to come back to the UK.
