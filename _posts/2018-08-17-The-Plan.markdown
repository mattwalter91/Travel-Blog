So, where to begin with our plan...

This has been in the works for a couple of years now. Our main theme for some places we are heading is for wrestling. This is something Matt and I enjoy, and we want to experience wrestling in the various countries we visit. 

So our journey around the world will begin 17th August 2018 where we are going to head from London to New York. We have two things we want to do in New York. 1.) Go to an NXT Takeover, which has is something I have never seen, but Matt has a few times. 2.) Visit Central Park. Unfortunately, when we visited New York in October 2017 we had pretty wet weather, so therefore never got to see all of Central Park.

After New York we move onto Cancun where we have booked two tours which explore Chichen Itza, the Mayan Underworld, and Isla Mujeres.

We will then continue our journey to Mexico City where we are going to spend a total of 5 days exploring the City. Whilst here we're aiming to visit Arena Mexico to watch some Lucha Libre Wrestling. Oh, and sample the amazing food!

Our journey then progresses to San Franciso where we will visit Yosemite Valley National Park, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz Prision amongst other things in our 5 days here!

We then move onto Honolulu, Hawaii where we are hoping to spend most of our time relaxing for our 7 day stay. We've not yet booked any tours here, but hope to visit some of the other islands whilst we're over here.

Our final booked destination is to Auckland, New Zealand which is where we expect to be until Christmas. During our time in Auckland, I aim to find myself a short term job, to help raise money for the rest of our trip. Our current plan is to spend Christmas in Fiji, and then New Year in Japan where we're also hoping to go to an NJPW show! 

Beyond that, we have a rough plan to then move to South Island, New Zealand and purchase a ticket for a Hop-on-Hop-Off Bus, and give ourselves until mid-March to explore before heading back to North Island. We then aim to visit Sydney, Tasmania, and Bali before heading back to England some time in May.

As mentioned, nothing beyond Auckland is booked yet, so this may change along the way.

Expect lots more updates here along with the best pics from our trip, and next time we write on here it will be the start of our journey to the other side of the world!
