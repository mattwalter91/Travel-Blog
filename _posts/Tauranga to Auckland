Monday evening we were hoping to head to the Redwood treetop walk, but sadly the weather was against us, so we are hoping to do this when we return to Rotorua in 10 days time. We had the rest of the evening, getting ourselves ready to move out and head to Tauranga tomorrow.

Tuesday was already here and we left just after 10am, and made our way to Tauranga shopping Mall, where we found a shop which stocks our favourite bath salts 'Dr Teals.' Whilst in the mall we stopped for lunch at Pita Pit which is a bit like a subway. After lunch we had a look around the shops, before heading off to Tairua, which is near the Coromandel. We chose to revisit the motel we previously stayed at in late January, as we enjoyed the location and the views over the bay. Once we arrived we had a quiet evening, seeing the sunset before heading to bed. 

Wednesday we woke up to sadly more rain! We hoped that we had seen the last of the rain but sadly it seems to be following us! We had planned to climb to Mount Paku Summit which is a short 5 minute drive from the Motel, but we postponed this until the rain cleared, so we instead had a quiet morning, and then headed our after lunch. The climb was very steep, but once at the top the views were great, if only there was a little sunshine then it would of been incredible! After the steep walk up we headed back down the summit to the car and back to the house for the rest of the afternoon, so Matt was able to work. Tomorrow we move back to Auckland, we are going to be based just North of Auckland in Birkenhead, in the accomadation we have booked for when Matts family join us on Monday! We are looking forward to heading back to the City where it all began, we plan to do a few things around Auckland, but mainly we will just be getting ready for when the family join us.
