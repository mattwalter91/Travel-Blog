Tuesday was an early start as we headed to the Airport for 11am for our 3pm flight. The travel to the airport was certainly less busy than the journey when we arrived in Mexico City. Once at the airport we were soon on the flight which included a short layover in Los Angeled. We arrvied at 9pm, so quite late, but luckily as we had already gone through customs in Los Angeles so were able to quickly pick up our bags and head to catch a taxi to our hotel.

Wednesday was an early start as we were up at 6.30am for a tour. We ate breakfast at the hotel, and then made our way to Pier 33 to board a ferry to Alcatraz. There was a long queue for the ferry across to the island, but luckily we were on the 9.10am ferry. Once across the island we got ourselves a brochure and headed around the island where we saw the remains of the prison. Once we reached the main cells, we had a headset audio tour, which was incredible to hear about all the various rooms in the prison, and the history behind it all. We came away from the tour amazed by the information provided. We had finished the tour by around 11am, so we caught the next available ferry and headed back the the mainland, where we decided to explore, Pier 39, Little Italy, China Town, and Union Square before heading for some lunch on the way to the hotel. We then went out a bit later for dinner at the Westfield Shopping Centre. We ended the day with an early night as we had a VERY early start for our second tour!

The alarm buzzed at 4.45am for us to get up and be ready for our Yosemite tour, which had a pickup at 5.40am. Once on the bus we spent the next 2 hours catching as much sleep as we could, even though sleeping was hard when you are being shaken all over the place by the bus! Luckily we stopped about half way at a place called Oakdale, where we got to get off the bus for about 25 minutes for a quick breakfast. We'd been very organised and brought our own breakfast, but we got a few extra bits whilst we were there! On the road we went another 2 hours before we arrived at the first destination of our tour - the Sequoia National Park, where we stopped for an hour and a half to walk around the huge Sequoias. Our next stop was the breathtaking Yosemite Park, which we had the chance to walk around for a while before making our way back to San Francisio. Our guide Ben was fantastic; he had such a wide range of knowledge of all the national parks near by, and knew exactly where to stop for the best photos!
	Whilst on our tour we got chatting to a few people, and have made a few contacts for our further travels as we met a couple from Melbourne and a guy named Jabyn from Christchurch. We are hoping to keep in contact, with the hope that they'd be kind enough to show us around their cities when we inevitably visit! The day in Yosemite ended about 3.30pm, and, after a couple more stops, we were back in San Francisco by 8pm.

Friday morning was luckily not such an early start as Thursday, but we headed off to Union Square where we were being picked up for our final booked tour which was to the Muir Woods and Sausalito town. The tour began with a 1 hour drive to the Muir Woods national park, where our tour guide/bus driver John was full of knowledge on not just the Woods, but the history behind most places in San Francisco! Once in Muir Woods we were given an hour and a half to explore, which was great as the sun was shining through the top of the 300ft trees. When we first stepped into the woods the smell was so fresh, it was just out of this world! We decided to follow a marked 2 mile route before heading back to bus via the gift shop. We then had a 30 minute bus journey to the wealthy bay side town of Sausalito. There wasn't much to see here, so we didn't stay long before catching the ferry back to San Francisco. Once we docked we looked around the Ferry Terminal before moving on to Westfields again to look around the shops. Tomorrow we have plans to head to Fishermans Wharf, and onto Lombard Street before visiting Golden Gate Park and the Japenese Tea Garden. We were hoping the mist over the bay would rise enough to get a great photo of the Golden Gate Bridge!

It was great to wake up Saturday without and alarm clock going off! Once we rose, we headed out to meet Jabyn (from our Yosemite tour). We walked to Fishermans wharf which was literally just outside Jabyn's hotel. Once we met up we made our way to a point of Pier 41 and managed to get a good photo of the Golden Gate bridge. We were thinking of getting alot closer, but unfortunately it was quite out the way with not much around it to make the walk worth it. So once we took a photo of the bridge we headed back to Fishermans Wharf to the US Pampanito Submarine for another audio tour similar to that at Alcatraz. It was good to learn about the lifestyle lead by the crew onboard and get a sense of what they went through in day to day under the sea.. Once we finished our tour we headed to Pier 39 where we saw the sea lions and walked through the buzzing atmosphere of the pier. This was great but due to it being a Saturday it was generally a lot busier that usual! We then decided to take the steep uphill walk to Lombard Street, where there is a well known 'bendy street'. I certainly would not fancy driving down it thats for sure! We moved on to the Golden Gate Park, which weirdly is not next to the Golden Gate bridge but quite a distance from where we were at Lombard street, so we made the decision to catch an Uber to the park. We wandered around a bit vaguely heading for the Japanese Tea Garden, which was literally like walking into another little world! The Golden Gate Park itself is very much similar to Manhattans Central Park in that there is many hidden parts to the Park which makes it quirky but great! After all the walking we decided to make a stop off at a vegan burger restaurant, which was the best burger we had eaten for a long while! Once refuelled we made our way back to the hotel, where we decided to rest as Sunday was to be an early start with our flight to Honolulu, Hawaii taking off at 9.00am.
