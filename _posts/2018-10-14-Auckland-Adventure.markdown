So the past week has been the usual 9-6 working, so sadly not much time for travelling during the week. This weekend was our first proper weekend where we actually headed away from the towns and cities as we travelled west.

9.30am Saturday we went and collected our hire car, which was pretty reasonable for both of us and the best mode of transport to get to where we were heading! Our first route was to head to the Waitakere Ranges. Sadly once we arrived the Kitekite track was closed due to a toxic algae which has affected the reserves, and as New Zealand is so careful regarding its nature, we were unfortunately unable to visit this waterfall. We then headed on to Piha beach, where we walked along the beach which was actually black sand! We walked to a rock just off the shoreline called Lions Rock, today was actually pretty windy so was very much a cool walk along the coast! When we got alot clsoer to Lions Rock, we noticed there was a river which ran straight into the ocean from the land, so we needed to find a way to get across the water, luckily there was some rocks high enough that we would not get our feet wet so we decided to head over to rocks and go explore Lions Rock. Once over by the rocks we had to navigate a few larger rocks to get to the start of the steep staircase taking you to the top of Lions Rock. The view was incredible viewing point looking over Piha bay. Well worth the steep climb up the steps for sure!

Once we have taken in the incredible views from Piha bay, we headed back to the car. This was an entertaining trip back, as we stepped on the rocks over the river from before, the tide came in, and we got soaked from the knee down! Not an enjoyable moment!

Once back to the car with wet and sandy feet, we headed to Kerekere waterfall, with the hope that this one wouldn't also be closed! Luckily the pathways were open so we managed to see a beautiful waterfall, which had no one else around! We then headed towards the nearby beach, which again was black sand! Once we had locked around the marshlands we headed on to Bethells beach, which we briefly visited as the sea air had got to us and made us very sleepy! The beach itself seemed a very popular destination for surfers, and there sure were some great waves!

Saturday evening, we decided to go watch a film at the nearby Lynn Mall. Tickets are only around £5!

We have a few awesome places we are heading to over the next few weeks so watch this space!

P.S sorry for the slow update on the blog, but as we are working during the week and only out at weeekends, it's best to post roughly every other week. Once we are not working over the Christmas period hopefully it will be more frequent! For now noho iho rā (means goodbye in Maori!)
