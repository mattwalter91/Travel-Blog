Monday was a day of travelling from Invercargill to Cromwell, Central Otago, which is 45 minutes from Queenstown. The journey from Invercargill to Cromwell was 2 hour 30 minutes. We left Invercargill by 10.00am and got to Cromwell by 1pm. Once in Cromwell, we stopped in town and grabbed lunch at a little Mexican restaurant. After lunch we headed to our apartment for the next 5 nights which was in a 3 bed studio apartment within an industrial park. The place was huge but sadly the air con had not been put on so on a hot day like today it was incredibly warm! After getting moved in, Ivona and Nikki headed out for a little walk and to grab a small food shop for the week. Once in we headed to bed before a fun week in Central Otago.

Tuesday we headed out at 10am to Queenstown, where we decided to head to the Skyline park, where we took a ride up the Gondola, and once at the top look a ride on a downhill luge! It was great fun, and brought out our inner child! After the luge we took in the great views, we headed back down the Gondola before grabbing something for lunch, we were going to head to the well known Fergburger, but the line was ridiculously long, therefore we found a lovely little Italian restaurant near the lake, which we stopped at for lunch. Once lunch was eaten, we headed for a walk round the town and headed to a souvenir shop to grab a few souvenirs. After a little shopping was done, we headed to the Kiwi Birdlife, which was a sanctuary for kiwis and many new zealand birds and reptiles, whilst there we got to see a Kiwi feeding session and see the Kiwi, which was great to see, as it's rare to see them in the wild due to being a nocturnal animal. After the visit to the Kiwi Birdlife sanctuary we headed back to the car before making our way home. Before an early night as Wednesday was going to be a long day.

Today we headed to Mount Cook National park, which was a 2 hour 30 minute drive away. We left at 8.30am, to make a full day as the Hooker Valley walk we would be doing was a 3 hour return walk, therefore we needed to allow enough time for the walk and the further stops. On the way the weather was worrying us all as we drove through thick fog, and we all had dressed for a hot day, so we were praying for warm weather and luckily the closer we came to Mount Cook National park the warmer it became. Once at the Hooker Valley track, we parked up before preparing ourselves for the 3 hour return walk, which took us by the Mount Cook peaks, which was covered in snow and glaciers. On the track there were 3 swing brings which crossed the valley floor. Once we crossed the third swing bring we followed the track, until it lead us to Hooker Lake, which was great as there was fallen icebergs in the lake! The water was freezing and on a very hot it was quite a treat! After a short stop and lunch by the lake, we made our way back to the car, and by the time we were back at the car, we could've given a cherry tomato a run for its money! Although we got very burnt the scenery was incredible and was well worth the long trip! After feeling a bit burnt, we headed to NZ Alpine Lavender farm which was a short 15 minute journey from Hooker Valley, there were just 10 hectares of lavender which was incredible to see, but sadly last month was when the lavender was harvested therefore it was a sea of green rather than purple! (The photo I have is actually a photo!) Once a short visit at the lavender farm, we headed to Lake Tekapo which was a 45 minute journey, once at Lake Tekapo, we went to view the beautiful Lake Tekapo, and again sadly because its autumn the pretty flowers were not fully out in flower but it was still very pretty. After Lake Tekapo we made a quick stop off at Lake Pukaki viewing point, where Mount Cook was in view over the lake. After a quick stop we made the long 2 hour 30 minute drive home, we finally got home by 7pm, so a very long day for all of us.

Thursday Ivona and I headed out to Queenstown Hill, where we walked the Queenstown time trial, which was great and the views of Queenstown were incredible. The steep 500m climb was well worth it! After taking in the views and catching our breath at the top, we headed back down to the car and made our way to the outskirts of Queenstown where we stopped for lunch, before heading to Gibbston Valley Winery where we had a 3pm wine tour, through the Wine Cave, where we got to try some Riesling, Pinot Gris and Ros√©, my favourite was definitely the Pinot Gris and the Rose, although the Riesling was definitely great too! If I wasn't driving I would of happily had a few extra glasses in the sun! After a lovely winery tasting, we headed home via a quick stop at Roaring Meg, which is part of a hydro electricity power station.

It was already another end to the week and Ivonas last full final day with both Matt and I, so today Matt had calls until 11am, therefore Ivona and I decided to head out after breakfast for a walk around Lake Dunstan, although it was not around the whole lake, just a short 5 km walk round the Northern part of the lake along with a walk through 'Old Cromwell' town. We actually walked slightly further than 5 km as because we roughly walk at 6km per hour, we decided to walk further round by the lake before heading back to the car, and also to give Matt the couple of hours he needed to get on with work. The little town of Cromwell was great to see, as now a days the old parts of towns are pretty much vanishing as there is so much more newer buildings being built but for the small quirky town to still being used and some buildings being restored and used as little Art galleries and cafes it makes a great touch. From the little town we followed the waters edge which was on our right and followed the lakeside path, until we decided to turn back and head back towards the car, once we had turned around we spotted a farm shop and juice shop on the highway, so we decided to have a look around before heading back to the car. The shop has loads of local stone fruit which looked amazing although sadly neither of us brought our purses therefore we could not buy any! After the shop we made our way back towards Old cromwell, where we took some final pictures before getting back in the car and heading back to the house for Lunch. Once we had a bit of lunch all three of us set off to the Blue Pools which was in Makarora, which was a 1 hour 30 minute drive, once there we made the short 1.5km return walk to the blue pools which were incredible, although the sandflies were nasty! We also bumped into Nikki's work colleague Jess which was a nice surprise! After a quick few snapshots of the blue pools and watching some fools jumped from the swing bridge we headed back to the car and headed to Lake Wanaka, but on the way we stopped for a few photos of Lake Hawea which was one of the lakes we drove by on the way to Lake Wanaka. Due to the great weather we managed to get some great mirrored photos of the mountains in the lake! THe photos don't look real, but i can assure you they most certainly are!! After a further 50 km we soon arrived at Lake Wanaka/Roys Bay where the famous tree was, and there were many taking photos but luckily we got our perfect shot and it was great to go on a little walk by the lake also, but the weather was a near 30C so keeping out the sun was our plan! After a lovely walk, we headed back to the car and were home by just before 7pm where we grabbed some food before heading to bed.

Saturday was here and today was Ivonas final day with us, Matt said goodbye to Ivona from the house and just Ivona and I were going out today. On Wednesday Ivona and I called in at AJ Hackett's Bungy centre, where we watched a few people do the bungy over the Gorge and Ivona was unsure on whether to do it so today on Ivonas last day we went back, as Ivona felt if she didn't do it when would she, and whilst in Queenstown/New Zealand its a must do! So after some much needed thought and reassurance she done the jump! And what a great time she had! So after her jump we headed off to a little town called Arrowtown which is a historic gold mining town, where we browsed the shops and Chinese Settlement before making our way to Queenstown for a spot of lunch by the water, before I dropped Ivona at the airport by 3pm. After dropped Ivona off I made by way back to the house, where Matt and I got a few bits from the shop for dinner before having a quiet night in before we move tomorrow, which means we have travelled to the most southern point of New Zealand and now we are making our way back to the North Island.
