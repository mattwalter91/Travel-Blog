Wednesday has now come upon us and yet again we are off on the move again. Today we finish the Northland trip, which has been lovely, and now make our way to the Coromandel Peninsula. We left Parakai where we were staying at the Geothermal Hotel, and made the lengthy 1hour 20 minute journey to Hunua Falls, which was just south of Auckland City. After the long drive we made our way to the Hunua Falls reserve where we parked up and looked at the wonderful 30 metre high falls. Once we admired the falls we made the decision to head for a walk round the reserve, we choose to head to the Cosseys Dam, which was a very long uphill walk, and after the mistake of not taking the water bottle, once we reached the Dam which was a good 45 minute uphill walk, we were very thirsty.  We took in the views before making our way back to the car, as we were pretty much gasping for a drink! Once back at the car we made the 1 hour journey to Thames which is just into the Coromandel Peninsula. We popped to the shops before making our way to the Coastal Motor Lodge where we are staying for the night before heading up to the Coromandel.
