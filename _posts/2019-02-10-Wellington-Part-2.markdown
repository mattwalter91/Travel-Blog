Tuesday was around and we caught the number 1 bus from a few minute walk from the apartment and headed to Te Papa museum which is the museum of New Zealand. This was a short 20 minute journey before we arrived and made our way to the museum, as like most museums this was free entry, so we could walk around and learn about New Zealand's history. The museum was great and it was great to see the huge 2 metre tall, life-like war statues which were actually created at the Weta studios! After the museum we made our way to Mount Victoria summit which was a steep climb but once up there was well worth the views over Wellington although it was very windy! After taking in the beautiful scenery we headed back down and on our way back down we were met with a slide which was the way down part of the mountain which was great fun! We had hoped this went all the way down! After we enjoyed our inner child down the slide we headed back towards the apartment only making a quick stop at a fish and chip stops for some chips! We then headed home to eat our chips before having a quiet evening.

Wednesday was a day of rest as climbing Mount victoria was pretty tiring, so we decided to use today to book the remainder of our trip, so its now a nice feeling that we have everything booked until we leave now! 

Thursday we had a trip on the 18e bus to Zealandia which is a ecosanctuary to all the native wildlife in New Zealand. We decided to go after lunch so we can make sure we eat all the food we have with us before moving to the south island on Sunday! We got to Zealandia at 13.30pm so once there we got our tickets and headed round the footpaths, hearing and seeing lots of native birds which was great to see! We unfortunately did not see any of the Kiwis but we are hoping to see some further on our trip. After spending over an hour at the Sanctuary we made our way back home for the evening and plan tomorrow's trip.

Friday was going to be the last day we went out to visit the sights of Wellington, as we will use saturday to get tidied up before our early start on Sunday to move down south. We began our day out at 11am today and hoped to catch a bus to the city but unfortunately there was a strike therefore bus services were reduced and because we don't know the bus services that well we decided to catch an uber to the parliament buildings - Beehive. The area round the parliament buildings definitely makes you feel like you are in a big city, although it's very different to the cities we have visited like Melbourne and Auckland. After looking at the parliament building we made our way to the renowned attractions of Wellington, the Wellington Cable car, which had a very long queue but was well worth the ride up the cable car to see the views from the top and to take a ride on the cable car. Once at the top we walked around the cable car museum and then walked around the Botanical Gardens, which we pretty much made our own paths as the walkways were not easily sign posted! After our walk round the gardens we made our way back on the cable car back to the city and headed for some lunch, we stopped at two places for lunch as we went to a vegan cafe which served many types of vegan cakes and desserts, which we both had one each: Red velvet cake and Chocolate pie, with a drink, which were very yummy! We then went to Plant Based which is vegan fast food hut, which was very yummy but after having cake first we were very full! After lunch we headed back to the apartment, for the rest of the afternoon we shall plan our trip in south island, as there is some fires in Nelson which is along from Richmond where we shall be staying from Sunday for the next 10 days.

Saturday was around and we mapped out the rest of our trip, so we can plan what we are going to do in the South island, especially due to the current fires in Nelson which is a close 20km from where we are staying! We then made sure we had an early night as we were up early on Sunday to get the 9am ferry to Picton.
