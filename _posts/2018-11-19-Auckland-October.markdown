Since our previous write up we have had a few trips at the weekends, and moved to a couple of times. All of our accommodation going forward is private, which is much more out style!

As usual the weekdays have just been the busy working week earning those pennies for our travels. The weekend of the 20th October was spent heading into the city from New Lynn, where we were staying, to go play minigolf at HoleyMoley golf course by the Viaduct Basin, so right by the beautiful harbour, where the most amazing yachts can be seen. The round of golf was not the usual type as it was inside, and each hole had its own theme (e.g. chess, shipwreck, living room) and some were played on carpet which was weird! As usual Matt won the game, although it was a very close score! Once we finished golf we headed for a bite to eat before making our way back the New Lynn, after doing a usual food shop for the week. We also went to the nearby cinema to watch Venom, as over here we seem to be lucky that this particular cinema has cheap tickets so nice to be able to watch a few films whilst we are over here!

The weekend of the 27th was a pretty exciting one as it was a weekend which we would spend a night away. We had made the decision to book a car and take the 2 hour trip down to Hamilton, from which we headed to go explore the Waitomo glow-worm caves and Bridal Veil falls. So our weekend began 9.30am on Saturday to pick up our car for the weekend, and make our way down to Raglan, where the waterall is situated. Once parked up we made the short 10 minute walk through the woods to the first of 3 platforms of the falls, the first was at the top of the falls looking down, and what a spectacular view this was! Once we had taken in the views we headed down to the very bottom of the falls, where the view was incredible! The waterfalls around here are so great, untouched, and special! After we had finished taking in the falls we made the tiring climb back to the top and back to the car to start the 40 minute journey to Hamilton where we had a room booked for the night at a Motel.

Sunday was a wet start to the day, but luckily by the time we made the 1 hour journey to the Waitomo caves the day had brightened up. Once we arrived at the glow worm caves, we got our tickets and began the day in the 1st of 3 cave experiences we had boought. So within 15 minutes we were making our way through the dark caves, and once in we saw thousands of little glow worms all over the roof of the caves! Sadly photos were not allowed, but it looked so magical! Once we had finished the tour in the glow worm caves we decided to try change our timings for our next two caves due to wanting to make3sure we would get back to the city in good time. Luckily the team at the Waitomo caves were great and happy to assist us. We then headed off for our next tour which meant a short 5 minute drive to the next two caves Ruakuri cave and Aranui cave, both of which had great limestone formations, but sadly didnt come close to the caves we saw when in Mexico! Once we had visited both caves we made our way back to the car and started the 2h30m journey back to New Lynn. Luckily we had the car until Monday morning at 9am so Nikki was able to drop the car on the way to work!

We're now staying in the city, with our next two places very close to it still. Summer's well underway here, and it's strange to be walking around without a jumper in November!
