Sunday was an early start and our trip to the ferry terminal was a very chatty one in the uber. Once at the ferry terminal we checked our bags in and made our way onto the Interislander ferry, which was a very large 10 levels, even though 5 of those were for cars, it was very large and there was many level to find a spare seat as it seemed everyone was on the ferry early to grab a seat! We managed to find a lovely family lounge on level 7 where we got a couple of armchairs which were comfy enough for a good half an hour sleep, to make the time go by a little faster as we had a long 3 hour journey. Once we were a couple of hours in we decided to make our way onto the viewing deck on level 10 to see the beautiful Marlborough Sounds, which were truly breathtaking! If this is only the start of the South Island, this is going to be simply awesome! Once we arrived at Picton Ferry Terminal, we made our way off the ferry and made our way to the luggage belt, we noticed the Apex Rental car kiosk was also right by the Luggage belt therefore Matt went to the kiosk and I waiting by the luggage belt for our backpacks to come. Once we finally got both the luggage and the keys to our Toyota Corolla for the next 24 days, we found the car and made the 2 hour drive to our accommodation for the next 10 days. Before arriving at the house we stopped off at the shops which is a short 5 minutes from the house and collected something for dinner before heading to bed as we were both very tired! 

Monday was around and we had a quiet morning and headed to the shops to do a shop for food for the next 5 days. After we collected the food we spent the rest of the day resting, as the next 3 days are going to be very busy, as there is a lot of driving to get to everywhere we are wanting to see. We are very excited to explore the south island, even with the large amount of driving!
