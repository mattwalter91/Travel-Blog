So after a great few days in Brooklyn our next stop was in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. When planning this trip we went to a travel agent to book a couple of tours as neither of us have ever been to Mexico before - one of the tours was a 4 day trip to Playa del Carmen seeing Chichen Itza and also the Mayan Underworld, where we would see cenotes and the Mexican underground river system.

So on Monday our journey began by catching a flight from Brooklyn to Cancun Airport. Once in Cancun and through security we caught a shuttle bus to our hotel in Playa Del Carmen. We stayed here for one night before moving onto our accomation which was booked throught STA travel for our tours in Playa del Carmen. The accomodation was at Hostel Playa - unfortunately there was no air con and lots of noise! On Wednesday after a very long sleepness night, we had a tour through Amigo Tours, which took us to the Chichen Itza site, where our tour guide Marco was amazing! His knowledge for the Mayan history and the various temples that we saw was incredible. The day was full of interesting facts about the Mayan lifestyle from back then to now.

The archaeological pyramids are so special in every way each pyramid has such a great story behind it. What was incredible is when we stood close to the Temple of Kukulkan the sound of a clap was echoed back as a amazing high pitch sound, something that in the Mayan culutre was always thought of being the Bird. Whilst on the tour we also saw the Stone Carvings, Temple of the Jaguars, Temple of the Warriors.

The tour ended with a lunch on the bus home. Once we were back from our tour we made the decision to change our accomodation in order to get a good night's rest with aircon and quietness! We found an AirBnB just round the corner from our hostel.

On Thursday we headed to the Mayan Underworld. This tour was not as early as the previous days tour; we met our guide at 8am at a local cafe and to our suprise we were the only ones on the tour. Paku, our tour guide, was great as he explained his background and his love of his job - teaching and letting tourists like ourselves see the wonders of Mexico's river system, the cenote caves underground. 
The tour was awesome, as we were walking through the darkness of the caves with just head lamps to light the way. The caves are filled by rainwater making its way through the rocks above. What felt like sand under foot was actually all calcium, so it was like a spa day! The caves were another major part of the Mayan culture, and it was incredible to hear Paku talk about the discoveries he has made in these caves at the heart of the jungle. He even showed us pictures of a Jaguar that lives in one of the nearby caves!
