So after an awesome day on Friday, we ended the day with a Pizza hut, as we were too tired from all the driving to make anything! After having some food we spent the evening in. Saturday Morning was soon upon us and we made our way out of the B&B and on the road by 10am. We had a long 1 hour journey ahead of us back down south. Once we finally arrived we made our first stop of the day at the Wairere Boulders, which to be honest niether Matt or I knew exactly what this was! It turns out it was a paid trail around a selection of boulders. The trial was a 1hour trail, walking on various surfaces including climbing over some boulders! The walk was mainly in the shade of the folage all around, which was lovely as the heat was hard work. The trial was great as there was a lovely water pool and also a lookout which was great to see all the different sizes of boulders. Unfortunately on the way down from the lookout, Nikki managed to not pick up her feet and had a little fall where she just tweaked her ankle! This was still a good 40 minute walk to the car, but luckily Nikki managed to get up and keep on going! Once we got back to the car we then made the long 1 hour 30 journey to Tane Mahuta in the Waipoua Forest. Once we arrived we made the short walk to the large tree and take a few photos before making our way to our next accomadation for the next two days which is on the west coast near to Dargaville. We are taking the weekend a little steady as all the driving and moving around has got to us!

After a lovely nights sleep at the lovely Pavillion which was an entire home to ourselves, a nice change to all the recent hotels. We had a lovely lie in, due to the large amount of driving and moving around we have done in the last week. Once up, we made our way to Dargaville where we popped to the shops and then a quick visit to Glinks Gully, which was a beach for those with dirt bikes or quad bikes and although the sea was pretty wild-*apparently this is the normal for this part of the beach* we only briefly stayed at the beach, and had a little walk along the beach, before heading back to the house. We then made use of the rest of the day to chill out as we have another long journey Monday, moving down to our next accomadation.

So the weekend has flown by and Monday was a day of moving from Dargaville to Helensville, where our next hotel-Parakai Geothermal Motel was for the next two nights. We made the decision to not go visit anywhere today mainly to give Nikki's ankle a rest but also to give us both a break, as all the moving about has got on top of us a bit! Before we got going too far we stopped off for breakfast at a newly opened vegan cafe in Dargaville, which was a lovely little find, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here before getting on the road. So after the long 2 hour journey we arrived at our hotel, which was a lovely self contained apartment with a hot tub with mineral water in which is great! Tuesday is going to be more about seeing the sights which are nearby so plenty more to write about tomorrow especially as we shall be well rested.

After a early wake up call by the workmen working on the next cabin from ours at 7.30am, we had a quiet morning and at about 10.30am we headed to the Southern Head/Mosquito beach which was a short 30km drive. Once we were there we made our way to Mosquito beach which was a little secluded beach, unfortunately nothing like the bright blue sea and white sane we had seen on the east coast. Once we had a little walk along the beach we headed back up a very steep walkway to the car before making our way to Lake Ototoa, which was a lovely lake but unfortunately is was not very easy to capture a lovely picture mainly because there was not a clear spot in the trees to take a photo. Once we manageged to capture the best shot we could of this beautiful clear lake we headed back to the car and onto our final stop of the day being Shelly Beach, which pretty much as the name suggests is a beach which many shells on it. The beach unfortunately seems to have alot of workman and concrete blocks around, therefore we didnt even take a photo as we were to be honest, a little disappointed. We have been very lucky with the weather over the past week and as we were on our way back to the hotel, the rain began to fall pretty heavy so luckily we timed our trip out perfectly. Today is our last evening at the Geothermal Hotel, so tomorrow we shall be moving towards the Coromandel, where we are hoping the sun will join us!
