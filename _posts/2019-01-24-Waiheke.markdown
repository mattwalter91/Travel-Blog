After a very warm evening in the small apartment in the city, we had a quiet morning in the city before catching the 12.30pm Ferry across to Waiheke Island which is at the Downtown Ferry Terminal, which we got to via a Uber only becuase its quite a long walk to carry our 17kg backpacks. The weather in the City was pretty miserable this morning, so we were a bit worried we were in for bad weather but luckily by the time we got to the ferry the weather was alot more pleasing, which made the boat journey very enjoyable. Once we got off the Ferry at Waiheke we decided to take a taxi to our home for the next 3 nights at Guest house on Queens, which is a lovely 1 bedroom house. The gentleman who owns to accomadation (Ray) warmly greeted us and very kindly gave us lots of great places to visit whilst we are over here in Waiheke, once settled in we were also offered a free car journey by Ray, to the Shops to get everything we require in for the next few days. The rest of the afternoon is going to be planning the rest of our trip. Although this island is about 90 km long, we have not booked a car only because there are great public transport and good walking routes, round the island. So Monday will soon be upon us and we have lots of great ideas planned whilst we are here.

After a lovely first evening in the Guest house, we decided to get up about 9am, and catch a bus which is a short 5 minute walk from the house to Oneroa, which is a beachy town, where we browsed to shops before doing a beach side walk over Little Oneroa and Oneroa beach as well as Fishermans Rock look out. Once we had a lovely walk by the beaches and saw the lovely lookout points we  had a lovely 15 minute walk back to the house, where we are having a quiet afternoon, and organising the next few days travelling.

After another great evening in the Guest House we had a late start, and decided to go for a lovely walk by some of the other beaches. We walked from the house to Hekerua Bay, which was accessed by a path which crossed through a lovely reserve, from the bay we walked again by a trail to Sandy bay. From Sandy bay we went onto Enclosure bay, before making our way to our final beach being Little Palm beacg and Palm beach. We were advised that Little Palm beach was a nudest beach, and they were not lying! We walked by a few people in the nude on our way to Palm beach! Once we took in the natural scenery we made our way back to the road and headed to the nearest bus stop, before catching the bus back to the Guest House. Tomorrow will be a long day as we have a late flight to Melbourne. Today was really the last day we were out seeing some of the sights in Waiheke, which is safe to say a very beautiful island, like the many islands which surround New Zealand. We actually only covered about a third of the island as we will actually be making a return to Auckland in April when we will be here with Matts Family, and we will also have a car so we can get about the island alot more easier, than on foot or bus.
